Currently the extension only watches the `color-scheme` property and allows you to set
the following keys:

- `xdp.color-scheme`: Whether to watch the `color-scheme` property changes or not.
- `xdp.color-scheme-dark`: The theme name to use for dark scheme
- `xdp.color-scheme-light`: The theme name to use otherwise
